# markdown-portfolio
My first Markdown project, intended to share some info about me.
(Except there's a twist! It's not markdown... It WAS markdown, but it was visibly converted to HTML by [Dingus](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus "DaringFireball's Website").

Isn't it funny how GitHub will show the information the same way as my other repo, regardless of whether the raw code is presented as Markdown or as HTML?

This is the markdown portfolio, as it was, before I moved it to my first GitHub Pages locale!

Current files in real markdown are posted [here](https://github.com/pslempers/pslempers.github.io "My GitHub Pages Repo").
