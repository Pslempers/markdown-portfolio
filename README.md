# markdown-portfolio
My first Markdown project, intended to share some info about me.
(Except there's a twist! It's not markdown... It WAS markdown, but it was visibly converted to html by [Dingus](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus/ "DaringFireball's Website").

This is the markdown portfolio, as it was, before I moved it to my first GitHub Pages locale!
