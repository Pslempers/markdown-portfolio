<p>I've always aspired to be a well-rounded professional. I made this to help me seek future experiences that will allow me to sharpen many skills at once so I can continue to improve as a graceful collaborator.</p>

<p>I am passionate about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>facilitating safe spaces for growth,</p></li>
<li><p>designing tools and experiences that improve society and the well-being of others,</p></li>
<li><p>sharing music and games that bring people together and create lasting memories.</p></li>
</ul>
